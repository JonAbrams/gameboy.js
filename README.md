Gameboy.js â€“ Modified for Analogue Pocket Roms
==========

This is a modified version of Gameboy.js. It only runs `.pocket` roms that have been patched to run directly on the Analogue Pocket via an SD card. It should also work for `.pocket` roms exported from GB Studio.

Example Patch: https://twitter.com/bestpig/status/1472967996368953344

It does not verify that the boot logo on startup, so even if the rom works in this emulator it may not boot on the Pocket.
